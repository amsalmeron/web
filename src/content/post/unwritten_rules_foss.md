## The Why behind open source development.<a name="thewhy"></a>

**Voluntary Contribution and Passion-Driven Work**

One of the foundational unwritten rules of open source development is the spirit of voluntary contribution. Developers engage in open source projects out of sheer passion and the desire to make a positive impact on the community. This voluntary nature underpins the collaborative ethos of open source, creating a space where individuals come together to build something greater than themselves.

**Transparent Communication**

Clear and transparent communication is paramount in open source development. This includes providing comprehensive documentation, maintaining open channels for discussion, and offering constructive feedback. Developers should be responsive and willing to share their knowledge to foster a culture of learning and growth within the community.

**Respect for Diverse Perspectives**

Open source development transcends geographical, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. Embracing diversity in all its forms is not only an unwritten rule but also a strength of the open source community. Respecting diverse perspectives fosters creativity and ensures that solutions are robust, adaptable, and inclusive.

**Collaboration Over Competition**

In open source, the emphasis lies on collaboration rather than competition. Developers work together, pooling their expertise to create software that benefits the broader community. This cooperative mindset encourages the sharing of ideas, code, and knowledge, leading to the collective advancement of technology.

**Recognition and Attribution**

Acknowledging the contributions of individuals is a cornerstone of open source development. Every line of code, bug report, or documentation edit represents a valuable contribution. Proper attribution not only recognizes the effort put in but also motivates individuals to continue their valuable work.

**Code of Conduct and Inclusive Environment**

While not always explicitly stated, an unwritten rule within open source development is the adherence to a code of conduct that ensures a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all participants. This promotes a sense of belonging and encourages a diverse range of individuals to engage and contribute.

**Pragmatic Problem Solving**

Open source development places a premium on practical, real-world problem-solving. Developers focus on creating solutions that are effective, efficient, and adaptable to meet the needs of a wide range of users. This pragmatic approach leads to the development of robust, user-friendly software.

**Long-term Commitment and Sustainability**

Open source projects often require long-term commitment for their success and sustainability. Developers are encouraged to support and maintain their projects, ensuring that they remain relevant and continue to serve the community over time.


## Why should I contribute code for free? What are the real benefits here? <a name="whycontribute"></a>

Contributing code to open source projects without monetary compensation may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but there are several compelling reasons why individuals choose to participate in this collaborative ecosystem. Here are some of the key benefits:

## **Private vs. Public Open Source Models**:

**Private Open Source Model**:

In a private open source model, a company develops software using open source methodologies but keeps the codebase private. They may choose to selectively release parts of their code as open source, contribute to existing open source projects, or use open source software as part of their internal development process. Examples of companies following this model include Apple and Microsoft.

**Public Open Source Model**:

Companies following the public open source model develop their software entirely in the open, meaning that the source code is available for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. They often have a community of contributors from both within and outside the company. Examples of companies following this model include Red Hat (acquired by IBM) and Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu).

**Examples of Successful Companies Fully Embracing Open Source**:

**Red Hat (now part of IBM)**:

Red Hat is a pioneer in the open source industry. It provides enterprise solutions, including the popular Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system. Their business model is based on providing support, training, and services around their open source products.

**Canonical (Ubuntu)**:

Canonical is the company behind Ubuntu, one of the most widely used Linux distributions. While Ubuntu is free and open source, Canonical offers additional services like enterprise support, cloud management, and consulting.

**Automattic (WordPress)**:

WordPress, the popular content management system (CMS), is an open source project managed by Automattic. They offer various services including hosting, premium themes, and plugins.

**Elastic**:

Elastic develops the Elastic Stack, which includes Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats. These tools are widely used for search, logging, monitoring, and analytics. While the core software is open source, Elastic offers additional features and services under a commercial license.

**MongoDB**:

MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database. MongoDB Inc. offers a dual licensing model. The core database is open source, but they also provide an enterprise version with additional features and support.

**GitLab**:

GitLab provides a complete DevOps platform that covers source code management, CI/CD, monitoring, and more. The core GitLab software is open source, and they offer additional features through a commercial offering.

These examples illustrate that a successful business model can be built around open source software. Companies can provide value-added services, support, and premium features while still maintaining a strong commitment to open source principles.

In summary, the open source model has become a significant and sustainable approach for many successful companies. It not only fosters innovation but also provides opportunities for community collaboration and a means to deliver high-quality software to a global audience.
